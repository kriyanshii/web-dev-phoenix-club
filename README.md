# Phoenix Club WEB DEV BOOTCAMP
Hi I made this project during the 3 Days Workshop, conducted by <b> Phoenix Club
</b>.
I got to learn a lot during these 3 days and it was an amazing experience learning with Club Phoenix.

<br>I got to have hands on experience on:
<li>HTML
<li>CSS
<br>during these 3 days, and everything was explained from the very basics so that
anyone with zero experience on programming can learn.
